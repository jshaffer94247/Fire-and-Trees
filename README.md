# Introduction

In June 2020, a collection of data on tree outcomes following forest fires was published in [www.nature.com/scientificdata](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0522-7). This open dataset pulls together information from a variety of previously published and unpublished sources. This data includes:
- 409 fires
- 1981 - 2016
- 142 species and 62 genera
- 164,293 individual trees

This database has been made available for analysis, modeling, and to encourage the community to identify and address knowledge gaps.
